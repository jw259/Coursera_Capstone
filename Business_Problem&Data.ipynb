    "The Business Problem to be solved with the Capstone project is focussing on the estimation of the severity of car accidents depending on the defined route. The outcome of this project is relevant to anyone travelling by car as it gives a approximation on the danger of taking a planned route and therefore accidents can be prevented beforehand. Reducing the number of car accident using this prediction offers a great benefit for society!"
